# Requirement
We need to create a list of pet facility and pet shop and connect them with potential users. We already have connections. The idea is similar to booking.com or Agoda page
# System analysis and design for booking nanny website
The website consists of 6 pages, a header and a footer
## 1. Landing page
The most important page, consists of 5 sections:
### 1.1. Booking section
Include a place to advertise the page, and a booking form for customers to book services. 
* To advertise the page: use a photo and a slogan.
* To book services: booking form with: services (confinement nanny, one time / ad hoc, recurring / long-term), date and time picker, enquiries (optional), in grid styles. And button "continue".

(if signed in needed)
When a customer clicks this button, the system will ask if they have already signed up.

- if they've already signed up: the system will change to sign in form.
- if they've not: the system will change to sign up form, instructing them to create an account and come back to sign in form.

After signing in, the system will redirect to result page to choose the options.

(if we don't need authentication)
When button "continue" is clicked, the system will redirect to result page to choose the options.

### 1.2. Instruction section
* Include a media highlighting how to book, a step-by step instruction
* The media should be a video or slideshow showing how to book services.
The instruction should have a title, and a paragraph showing each step’s detail. The steps are presented in a vertical direction.

### 1.3. List of service providers / Popular pet caregivers
Show the list of current nanny providers, in grid style.
Each card contains: photos of nanny, name, experience (years), expertise (special skills), star rating, address

### 1.4. Testimonials
A place to show the reviews from customers (mostly positive reviews). Should be shown as a slideshow of cards. Each card contains: image and name of customer, his review, his star rating.

## 4. Service page
## 5. Result page

After signing in, the system will redirect to result page to choose the options:
