# System analysis and design for booking nanny website
The website consists of 6 pages, a header and a footer
## 1. Landing page
The most important page, consists of 5 sections:
### 1.1. Booking section
Include a place to advertise the page, and a booking form for customers to book services. 
* To advertise the page: use a photo and a slogan.
* To book services: list of available services (confinement nanny, one time / ad hoc, recurring / long-term), date and time picker, enquiries (optional), in grid styles. User then can look at each nanny, see if someone is match, choose someone to see details (redirect to detail page). Then they can choose someone and click "book now"

(if signed in needed)
When a customer clicks this button, the system will ask if they have already signed up.

- if they've already signed up: the system will change to sign in form.
- if they've not: the system will change to sign up form, instructing them to create an account and come back to sign in form.

After signing in, the system will redirect to another page to choose the options and fill in form, with more detail about your booking (when to get baby to sleep, etc...)
The options are a list of nannies, each with their experience, expertise, information, and their available time.

After completing it, user will pay deposit and click button "send request". Their information will be saved in the system and they will be redirected to payment page.

(if we don't need authentication)
A payment form will appear, showing that they should fill in a detail form (first name, last name, email address, id number, etc...), and button "send request". Their information will be saved in the system and they will be redirected to payment page.

### 1.2. Instruction section
* Include a media highlighting how to book, a step-by step instruction
* The media should be a video or slideshow showing how to book services.
The instruction should have a title, and a paragraph showing each step’s detail. The steps are presented in a vertical direction.

### 1.3. Testimonials
A place to show the reviews from customers (mostly positive reviews). Should be shown as a slideshow of cards. Each card contains: image and name of customer, his review, his star rating.

### 1.5. Section for service provider
